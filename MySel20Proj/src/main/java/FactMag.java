			.. 
			100 = 5x5x4 (one extra 5) 
			All of the 20 multiples of 5 up to 100 have one 5 each. The multiples 25,50,75 & 100 have one extra 5 each. Hence the total number of 5s = 24.
			Each of these twenty four 5s when multiplied by 2(which are at least 50 in number) yields a zero and hence the total number of 0s = 24.
